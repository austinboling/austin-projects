Miscellaneous programming/data projects done on my free time

## Melee

### StreamFriend.py

A python file to continuously check a tournament on smash.gg for its stream queue, then export the current Player names and tournament round on stream to text files. These text files can be easily used by OBS for stream overlay purposes.

### basedpy.py

A python file to scrape smash.gg API data to compile a comprehensive set history for any given player on smash.gg. Enter your tag and the URL/slug version of the tourney name (e.g. waveshine-infinite-12), and the script will export 2 csv files. One with singles results and one with doubles results. Details included are date, tournament, opponent, set count, and round.
